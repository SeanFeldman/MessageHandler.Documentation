# Accounts

Welcome to [MessageHandler](http://www.messagehandler.net), the first thing to do is create an account. You can create as many accounts as you like, at no cost, but you need at least one in order to get work done.

 There are 2 types of accounts:

 * **Personal:** As the name suggest, this is an account to represent you as a person.
 * **Organization:** This is an account intended to work in with multiple people, it could represent your company, department or a more temporary organization as you see fit.

This document links to some of the common actions that you can perform on your account
