# Creating an account

Welcome to [MessageHandler](http://www.messagehandler.net), the first thing to do is create an account. You can create as many accounts as you like, at no cost, but you need at least one in order to get work done.

 There are 2 types of accounts:

 * **Personal:** As the name suggest, this is an account to represent you as a person.
 * **Organization:** This is an account intended to work in with multiple people, it could represent your company, department or a more temporary organization as you see fit.

This document describes the steps to create an account

## Your first account

In order to create an account, you need to login first. You can do this either by clicking `Sign in` in the top left corner, select `Dashboard` in the top menu, or clicking `Create your account` on the homepage. You will be presented the following login screen.

Then click the button of your favorite identity provider to proceed. 

This document will continue showing the LinkedIn provider, other providers will show an alternative page instead. But in either case, this page is intended to authorize MessageHandler to use your identity for login purposes, besides your name and email we don't keep track of any other information even if the identity provider would present it to us.

Once you go ahead and authorize MessageHandler, you will be presented the create account form. Here you need to choose a unique name for your account, and select the type of account that you want to create.

## Subsequent accounts

As mentioned in the introduction, you can create as many accounts as you like, if you desire to add an additional account, you can do so by opening the dropdown underneath your account name in the top-left corner and select `New`. This will take you to the same account creation form as used initially to set up your first account.
