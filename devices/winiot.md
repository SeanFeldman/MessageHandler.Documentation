# Windows 10 IoT Core

Windows 10 IoT Core is the latest operating system for devices by Microsoft. Today, it runs on only a handful of devices and these devices are actually quite powerful. This has the benefit that it comes with a very rich programming model which will be familiar for most .Net developers, can leverage secure protocols and can support a broad range of scenarios. On the flip side these devices will also consume quite some power and won't run very long on battery. 

## Supported Devices

* Raspberry Pi 2
* MinnowBoard Max

## Supported Protocols

* [AMQPS](/documentation/devices/winiot/amqp)
* HTTPS

## Alternatives

If you are looking for a .Net oriented OS for more constrained low power environments, have a look at NetMF instead.

Before windows 10 IoT Core there were other windows based embedded OS'es

* Windows 8 Embedded
* Windows 7 Embedded
* Windows XP Embedded
