# How to contribute

Before you start ensure you have

 *  Created a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
 *	Understand the basics of [collaborating on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles)

## The GitHub web UI 

For simple changes the GitHub web UI should suffice.

 * Find the page you want to edit.
 * Click the `Improve this` button, this will take you to the GitHub copy of the markdown for this page.
  * Make the changes you require. Ensure you verify your changes in the `Preview` tab
 * Add a description of your changes
 * Click `Propose File Changes`
 
## By forking and submitting a pull request

For more complex changes you should fork and then submit a pull request. This is useful if you are proposing multiple file changes

 * [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) on GitHub
 * Clone your fork locally
 * Work on your changes
 * Push the commits to GitHub
 * Send a Pull Request on GitHub

## Markdown

The pages are currently rendered using [MarkdownDeep](http://www.toptensoftware.com/markdowndeep/) with *Markdown Extra Enhancements* enabled. 

As we apply a custom stylesheet in the documentation pages, there may be a significant difference between the GitHub flavoured Markdown and our visualisation. So when changes are accepted you should double check how the rendered version looks.

For editing markdown on your desktop using MarkdownDeep try the following

### [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/)

Ensure you enable *MarkdownDeep Extras* by going to 

    Tools > Options > Markdown > Markdown Processor > Markdown (Extra)  
	
### [MarkPad](http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF/) 

Ensure you enable *MarkdownDeep Extras* by going to 

    Settings > markdown extra > toggle the switch to red
