# Getting started

Welcome to [MessageHandler](http://www.messagehandler.net), the only online platform where you can collaborate on message processing logic. The goal of this platform is to be a place where companies and individuals, each an expert in their own field, can work together to collectively build the 'Internet of Every Thing'. 

## Quick start

Follow these steps to get up and running quickly.

 * [Sign in to create an account](/account/signin).
 * [Create a channel](/channels/add) to build your own processing logic or [select an existing channel from the gallery](/gallery/channels).
 * [Add handlers from the gallery](/gallery/handlers) to your channel, or [learn how to build your own] (/documentation/developing-handlers).
 * Deploy your channel to an environment of your choice.
 * [Assign an endpoint](/endpoints/new) to allow messages to flow into your channel.
 * [Connect](documentation/connectivity) your devices, websites, back end systems and so forth to get those messages flowing.
