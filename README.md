# Getting started

Welcome to [MessageHandler](http://www.messagehandler.net), the only online platform where you can collaborate on message processing logic. The goal of this platform is to be a place where companies and individuals, each an expert in their own field, can work together to collectively build the 'Internet of Every Thing'.

The concept behind our platform is fairly straightforward. It starts with data that travels from a source to a destination. And while the messages travel components, designed for you by different parties, respond to the content within.
