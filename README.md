## How to contribute

Before you start ensure you have

 *  Created a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)

### The GitHub web UI 

For simple changes the GitHub web UI should suffice.

 * Find the page you want to edit on http://messagehandler-alpha.cloudapp.net/
 * Click the `Improve this doc` this will take you to the GitHub copy of the markdown for this page.
 * Click `Edit`. This will automatically fork the project so you can edit the file.
 * Make the changes you require. Ensure you verify your changes in the `Preview` tab
 * Add a description of your changes
 * Click `Propose File Changes`
 
 ## Markdown

The pages are currently rendered using [MarkdownDeep](http://www.toptensoftware.com/markdowndeep/) with *Markdown Extra Enhancements* enabled. 

There are some slight difference between MarkdownDeep and the GitHub flavoured Markdown. So when changes are accepted you should double check how the rendered version looks.

For editing markdown on your desktop using MarkdownDeep try the following

### [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/)

Ensure you enable *MarkdownDeep Extras* by going to 

    Tools > Options > Markdown > Markdown Processor > Markdown (Extra)
