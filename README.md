# Getting started

Welcome to [MessageHandler](http://www.messagehandler.net), the online message processing platform. This platform allows you to collect data transmitted in real time (messages), process this data into more valuable information, and respond to the resulting information in any way you like (handle it). 

You can rent existing processing logic created by experts in the field, or, you can design your own in an easy way.

This page provides links to all the resources that you need to start learning about our platform. Use the flow suggested in this document for the most effective learning path, but you can skip sections that you are already familiar with.
