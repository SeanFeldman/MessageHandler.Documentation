# Adding Handlers to a channel

 * Adding handlers can be done from multiple different starting points. You could start from the public gallery, and click `Use this handler` or you could start from your private handler definitions and select `Use in channel` in the actions menu. 
 * Either way, MessageHandler will figure out what configuration properties are required by the given handler and offer you the correct input fiedlds that allow you to enter all the properties required by the selected handler.
 * At the bottom of this screen you can also switch the channel that the handler will be added to, or create a new one.
 * Hit `Go`.
 
 Once the handler has been added to the channel, you will be redirected back to the channel detail page.
