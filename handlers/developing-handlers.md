# Developing Handlers

In this series of articles we'll dive into the ins and outs of developing custom handlers. Custom handler development is a core feature of our platform. Not only will it let individual developers make, and sell, their message processing logic. But it also allows you to customize your channels in such a way that they will exactly fulfil your business needs and give you a competitive edge over the competition.
